# TODO

## UI

* [x] Adjust table component to allow better distribution of width space between columns. Currently the action column takes to much space in most cases.
* [ ] Combobox does not open when clicking on the text space. Because the forms are occupying all the horizontal space available, in larger screens the drop down trigger is at the far-right side
* [x] Add a 2-step book registration to upload a file after successfully registering a document.
* [x] Revise the pagination on all contexts
